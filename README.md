# obj-ledger

This package provides a Ledger class that wraps underlying objects to record changes to properties on the object. Only changes that do not strictly equal the previous value are recorded.

Supported Node version: 12+

## Usage

```javascript
const Ledger = require('obj-ledger')
const obj = { foo: 123, bar: 'abc' }
const ledger = new Ledger(obj)
ledger.update({
  foo: 456,
  bar: 'abc',
  foobar: true
})
console.log(ledger.log) //=> [{ foo: { from: 123, to: 456 }, foobar: { from: undefined, to: true } }]
console.log(ledger.final) // => { foo: 456, bar: 'abc', foobar: true }
```

### Properties

* `original` => A copy of the original object passed into the ledger. This object is frozen and no updates can be performed
* `final` => A copy of the object based on all updates that have been performed. This object is frozen and no updates can be performed
* `obj` => An object that can be used to get and set values that are currently tracked by the ledger.

### Instance Functions

* `update(values)` => Applies updates to the ledger based upon the key/value pairs passed into the function. All updates will be recorded in a single log entry
* `set(property, value)` => Sets the value of a property. If the property is not currently tracked by the `.obj` property, it will be added and the property can be updated directly in the future

### Class Functions

* `setProperty(ledger, property, value)` => Allows a new property to be tracked by the ledger. If an existing property is passed, this function will do nothing
* `deleteProperty(ledger, property)` => Deletes a property from the underlying object. This property will not be included when `.final` is invoked
